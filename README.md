Gregory's Portfolio

Description: A short summary of the websiteâ€™s purpose and main features.

This website is a portfolio that is made to give viewers and other incite about who I am, what I love , or want to do in the future, and the projects I have made so far

Design Choices: Explain the decisions you made about layout, navigation, styling, or functionality.

For my layout I wanted it to look more professional and clean. So I went with mainly black with white words and some cyan words to give it more of a pop and clean look

MVP Decisions: Describe why you chose these features for your minimum viable product.

The features I used was just functioning pages( you can switch between pages), A little text on the home and about page just so you can read about me and what I do, and lastly some slideshow pictures so you can visually see who I am and what I look like.

Contact Information: Explain how visitors can reach you (email link or other method).

The visitors will be able to reach me through my email and phone number which was not provided yet or coded yet into the project but will be there for future.

Challenges & Lessons Learned: Note any difficulties you encountered and how you solved them.

At first I didnt have any base projects or foundation to go off of because all my projects got deleted but I had to figure out other resources to use and someone actually found one of the most similar projects I ever coded to this one. Besides that I had no real challenges
