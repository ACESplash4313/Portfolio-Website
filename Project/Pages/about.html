        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Gregory. I’m interested in designing video games, fixing computers, and coding. I enjoy working with technology because it challenges me to think creatively and solve problems in new ways.
One of my biggest goals is to create my own video game in the future. I’m also focused on learning how to improve my coding skills and fix issues in programs so that they work better. I like being able to take something broken or incomplete and figure out how to make it run smoothly.
This portfolio is a place where I share my projects and the progress I’m making as I keep learning. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
